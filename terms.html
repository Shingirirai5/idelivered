  <h2>8. Restrictions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
     
      <p>8.1 You may view, download, and copy information and materials available on this Website solely for your personal, non-commercial use. Even though the iDeliverd Digital Technologies service is normally available, there will be occasions when the service will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of iDeliverd Digital Technologies. Also, although we will normally only delete User Content that violates this Agreement, we reserve the right to delete any User Content submitted to the iDeliverd Digital Technologies Site for any reason without prior notice to you. Deleted content may be stored by iDeliverd Digital Technologies in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, iDeliverd Digital Technologies encourages you to maintain your own backup of your User Content. In other words, iDeliverd Digital Technologies is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Site for the purposes of User Content backup or storage. iDeliverd Digital Technologies will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any User Content.</p>
    </li>
 
  </ol>

  <h2>9. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD, AND SECURITY</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>9.1 Since the Services require user and service provider to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing iDeliverd Digital Technologies with current, complete and accurate information as
        prompted by the applicable registration form. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur
        under your account. You agree to notify iDeliverd Digital Technologies immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. iDeliverd Digital Technologies will not be liable for any loss
        that user may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by iDeliverd Digital Technologies or
        another party due to someone else using user’s account or password.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. PAYMENT SECURITY</h2>
  <ul>
   
      <li>
      <p>
        10.1 The Site has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honoured. We take strong precautions to protect your data from
loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user
name and password, so do not share these with others.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        10.2 Since this is an intermediary and an ‘information only site’, we do not guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be entirely safe and secure. When you place orders through our website or
online payment gateway service providers (“OPGSPs”), listed on the Site, you must ensure that you agree to the terms and conditions of the said OPGSPs agreement. iDeliverd Digital Technologies
shall not be liable should there be a discrepancy in refund, loss or misuse of credit card details, hacking of sensitive
monetary information.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        10.3 Resolution of all payment related complaints shall remain the responsibility of OPGSPs concerned. Users must read and agree to privacy policy and online security framework of respective OPGSPs listed on
the Site before transacting. We do not take responsibility for any security lapse, should infringement or violation happen as a result of you accessing an OPGSP listed on the Site.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Feedback</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        11.1 All comments, feedback, information or materials submitted to iDeliverd Digital Technologies through or in association with our Website shall be considered no confidential and iDeliverd Digital Technologies
property. By submitting such comments, information, feedback, or materials to us, you agree to a no-charge assignment to iDeliverd Digital Technologies of worldwide rights to use, copy, modify, display and
distribute the submissions. iDeliverd Digital Technologies may use such comments, information or materials in any way it chooses in an
unrestricted basis. Users are welcome to provide candid feedback to us.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12. Cookie Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        12.1 When you visit our Site, we may place “cookies” on your computer to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences, collect statistical data and track your use of our Service. Cookies are
        widely used, and most web browsers are configured initially to accept cookies automatically. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you may adjust and configure your browser settings accordingly. However, if you turn
